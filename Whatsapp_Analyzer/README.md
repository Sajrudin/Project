## Project Overview
The **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** is a Python-based tool that allows users to analyze and visualize their WhatsApp chat data. The application processes chat export files in `.txt` format and generates insightful visualizations, including chat statistics, active user analysis, word clouds, emoji usage, and much more.

### Key Features:
- **Chat Statistics**: Overview of total messages, words, media shared, and links exchanged.

With WhatsApp being one of the most widely used communication platforms, users generate vast amounts of data through messages, media, and links. This tool helps users analyze their chat data to identify patterns, track their activity, and explore their communication behavior. By providing interactive charts and insightful statistics, the tool makes it easier for users to understand and visualize their WhatsApp interactions.

## Tools Used:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the web-based user interface.
- **Plotly**: Data visualization library for creating interactive charts.
- **Matplotlib**: For static data visualizations like word clouds.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library for handling chat data.
- **WordCloud**: Library for generating word clouds from the chat data.
